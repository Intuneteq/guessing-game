# Guess My Number Game

Welcome to Guess My Number Game, a mobile application developed using React Native. This app allows users to play a number guessing game where the computer attempts to guess a number chosen by the user.

## Features

- **Start Game Screen**: Allows users to input a number between 1 and 99.
- **Game Screen**: The computer guesses the user's chosen number using a binary search algorithm.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays the number of rounds it took for the computer to guess correctly and provides an option to start a new game.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: A JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications.
- **Expo**: A platform for developing and publishing React Native projects quickly.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety for JavaScript and improves code quality.
- **LinearGradient**: Used for applying gradient backgrounds to screens.
- **Vector Icons**: Includes icons from Ionicons for UI elements.
- **Custom Fonts**: OpenSans-Regular and OpenSans-Bold fonts are loaded for consistent typography.
